# kV-Field-Size

GUI + code to analyse kV images to find the kV field size. Please follow RTP 379 on iPassport for measurement.

This code will analyse the BMP files of the XRV4000 kV field measurements and output PNG images with the kV field outlines + CSV of the kV field sizes + kV field size report. 

For the code to work, the BMP files must be in one folder, and you will need to rename the files to YYMMDD_G(number)_(panel A or B). (e.g. 231006_G4_A)
